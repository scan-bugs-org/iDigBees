We are using GitHub as a framework to document, track ideas and suggestions, and generally help manage the [iDigBees project](https://idigbees.org/). 

You can submit project ideas, website suggestions, or other issues or comments on our [Issues Page for the project here](https://github.com/scan-bugs-org/iDigBees/issues). Submitting something is easy - just click the big green button on the right of the [issues page](https://github.com/scan-bugs-org/iDigBees/issues), fill in your comment, suggestion, or issue, and then click submit. More detailed information on how to [submit an issue on github can be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

You will need a GitHub account to add to or comment on the project - but it's free and super fast and easy to make an account! [Instructions/free account signup is here](https://github.com/join). 

Using GitHub is really the best way to help improve the project an make sure your request or comment is addressed, however, we understand not everyone is a fan. If you really don't want to sign up for a free account, you can email your thoughts to [Neil Cobb](neilscobb@gmail.com) or [Erika Tucker](mailto:emtuckerlab@gmail.com).
